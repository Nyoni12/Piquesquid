                  <div class="article-meta">By Godfrey Nyoni | May 1, 2025 | How AI Can Support Persons With Disabilities In Zimbabwe</div>
              </div>
              
              <div class="article-content">
                  <p>In Zimbabwe, persons with disabilities (PWDs) often face serious barriers in everyday life barriers to education, jobs, healthcare, and public services. Whether it’s the lack of ramps for wheelchairs, limited access to sign language interpreters, or materials that are not friendly for the visually impaired, life can be much harder for the country’s nearly 1.4 million citizens living with some form of disability. But today, a powerful new tool is offering hope for change: Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p>
                  <p>AI is not just for big businesses and tech companies it has the potential to improve the daily lives of Zimbabweans living with disabilities, helping them learn, work, move, communicate, and live more independently. Artificial Intelligence (AI) simply means technology that can “think” and “learn” like a human. It can: Understand voice commands, read and describe pictures, translate spoken language into text and help people control devices using simple movements or voice. For persons with disabilities, these features can break down barriers that have been limiting their opportunities for decades.</p>
                  <p>Zimbabwe’s Constitution (Section 83) guarantees rights for persons with disabilities. There are also policies like the National Disability Policy of 2021. But even with these protections, real daily challenges remain: Schools often lack learning materials for the blind or deaf, few buildings and public transport systems are disability-friendly, employment opportunities for persons with disabilities are limited and healthcare services are not easily accessible for those with mobility or communication challenges. Using AI can bridge many of these gaps faster and more affordably than traditional solutions.</p>
                  <p>Practical Ways AI Can Support Persons with Disabilities include: </p>
                  <p>1. Better Communication for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing; Apps powered by AI can translate spoken language into text instantly, allowing deaf people to participate fully in conversations. For example, Google’s Live Transcribe app converts speech into text in real-time. AI sign language interpreters are being developed, where an avatar “signs” spoken conversation.</p>
                  <p>2. Helping the Visually Impaired Navigate the World; AI apps can describe surroundings, read documents, and even identify currency for visually impaired persons. For example, Seeing AI by Microsoft can: read handwritten notes, recognize faces and emotions, describe scenes when you take a photo. Be My Eyes connects blind users with volunteers who assist via video call, supported by AI enhancements. In Zimbabwe, a visually impaired vendor could use these tools to identify products, read price tags, or find the right bus. </p>
                  <p>3. Education Tools for Students with Disabilities: AI can personalize education for students with disabilities: Read aloud textbooks for dyslexic learners, translate written notes into Braille and simplify complex learning materials for easier understanding. In 2023, King George VI School in Bulawayo, which caters for disabled children, started experimenting with digital learning tools. Adding AI can make learning even more inclusive.</p>
                  <p>4. Assistive Mobility Devices: AI-powered wheelchairs and navigation aids are helping people with mobility impairments move more easily. For examples, Smart wheelchairs that can be controlled with voice commands or even eye movements and apps that find wheelchair-accessible routes in cities. Though expensive now, future partnerships with NGOs and government could bring affordable versions to Zimbabwean towns.</p>
                  <p>5. AI in Employment and Skills Development: Finding work is one of the biggest challenges for PWDs in Zimbabwe. AI can help by: matching people to remote work opportunities based on their skills, helping disabled entrepreneurs set up online businesses and offering online courses adapted to different learning needs. Platforms like Upwork and Fiverr already use AI to match workers and clients. Local startups like AfriBlocks could integrate similar AI matching systems tailored for PWDs.</p>
                  <p>6. Healthcare Support: For those living with chronic illnesses or disabilities: AI chatbots can offer 24/7 medical advice, wearable devices can monitor health and send emergency alerts. AI can help doctors create more personalized treatment plans. At hospitals like Mpilo Central Hospital in Bulawayo or Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals in Harare, AI tools could reduce wait times and ensure patients with disabilities receive faster, appropriate care.</p>
                  <p>Zimbabwe is slowly moving toward digital inclusion; the Postal and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (POTRAZ) has launched ICT accessibility programs. Also, the 2021 National Disability Policy talks about using technology to support PWDs. NGOs like Leonard Cheshire Zimbabwe Trust and King George VI Centre are exploring assistive tech options. However, most AI tools are still out of reach for many due to high costs, low digital literacy, and lack of local solutions.</p>
                  <p>AI is not a magic wand. Zimbabwe must address several challenges, Internet Access: Many PWDs live in rural areas where network coverage is poor. Affordability: Most AI devices and apps are still priced for richer countries. Training: PWDs and their caregivers need training to use new technologies. Language Barriers: Many AI apps don’t support Ndebele, Shona or other local languages yet. Strong partnerships between government, tech companies, universities, and NGOs will be essential.</p>
                  <p>In Zimbabwe, persons with disabilities have long been pushed to the margins. AI offers a chance to change that to give them more independence, dignity, and opportunity. From using an app to attend school online, to navigating Harare’s busy streets with smart assistance, to finding work from their homes Zimbabweans with disabilities can thrive with the right tools. But it won’t happen by accident. It needs intentional investment, training, policy support, and awareness. It needs Zimbabweans whether policymakers, tech innovators, or ordinary citizens to believe that disability is not inability, especially in the age of AI. The future is here. Let’s make sure everyone gets a fair chance to be part of it.</p>

              </div>
              
              <div class="article-content">
                  <p>Zimbabwe, like many countries, faces serious challenges in delivering quality public services especially in health, transport, water, electricity, and local government. Long queues at government offices, slow responses, missing records, and poor communication between departments are things most citizens experience daily. But what if there was a way to make government faster, smarter, and more accountable? That’s where Artificial Intelligence (AI) comes in. Around the world, governments are using AI to improve how they operate from reducing corruption to tracking service delivery and responding to citizens faster. The question is: Can Zimbabwe do the same?</p>
                  <p>Let’s explore what smart governance means, where AI can help, what examples already exist, and what’s needed for it to work here. Smart governance refers to the use of technology especially data and AI to improve government operations. It means using digital tools to make public services: Faster, more accurate, more transparent, easier to access. It’s about making sure citizens get value from the government without wasting time, energy, or money.</p>
                  <p>AI can’t solve everything, but here are a few areas where it can bring serious improvements to Zimbabwe’s service delivery:</p>
                  <p>1. Improving Data Management; Many public departments still rely on manual record-keeping. Files go missing, and citizens have to visit offices over and over to fix issues. AI can: Digitize and organize huge amounts of data, help track public resources (e.g. how many boreholes are working in each district), spot inconsistencies or fraud (e.g. ghost workers or double payments). If you apply for a passport or birth certificate and it gets “lost in the system,” that’s a data problem AI could fix.</p>
                  <p>2. Chatbots and Virtual Assistants for Citizen Queries; Instead of waiting in line at ZIMRA, Zinara, or Home Affairs, AI chatbots could: Answer frequently asked questions (e.g. “What do I need to renew my licence?”), guide people step-by-step, operate 24/7 via WhatsApp or SMS. Estonia, Rwanda, and even South Africa already uses such systems to reduce congestion and speed up service.</p>
                  <p>3. Smart Traffic and Transport Systems; In cities like Harare and Bulawayo, traffic lights often don’t work and public transport is chaotic. AI-powered systems could: Monitor traffic in real time, adjust signal lights automatically, predict peak times for congestion, Local authorities could also use data to plan better roads, bus stops, or cycling paths, based on where people actually move.</p>
                  <p>4. Health Services and Early Outbreak Detection; AI can help in: Predicting and managing disease outbreaks, organizing hospital records, suggesting treatment plans based on patient symptoms. For example, AI tools helped detect COVID-19 outbreak patterns in other countries early. Zimbabwe could use similar models to manage diseases like cholera, typhoid, or even malaria.</p>
                  <p>5. Water and Power Usage Monitoring; Imagine an AI system that tells ZESA or ZINWA: Where leaks or faults are happening, when to cut or restore service based on usage patterns, how to plan water rations more fairly during dry seasons. This would reduce human error, delay, and unfair distribution of public utilities.</p>
                  <p>6. Fighting Corruption and Ghost Workers; AI systems can analyse patterns in payroll data, tender allocations, and procurement: Spot duplicate workers or inflated costs, raise red flags on suspicious payments, help public auditors work faster. Bots don’t take bribes so having them monitor budgets helps make public finances cleaner.</p>
                  <p>Do Any Zimbabweans Have Advanced System Examples Yet? Yes, a few exist, but they are still limited and in the early stages of development. Harare City Council launched a digital complaints system for service delivery, but it still needs automation and AI integration. ZIMRA’s e-services portal helps with online tax filing. AI could take it further with automated assistance. ZIMSTAT has started using digital data tools in census and surveys, a foundation for future AI-driven decisions. Startups like WorkYard are building platforms for workforce and project management using data analytics, which could support local governance if adopted. Other countries in Africa are leading this shift: Rwanda uses AI for land registration and tax services. Kenya has AI in its transport system to monitor traffic in Nairobi. Zimbabwe can learn from these.</p>
                  <p>AI sounds great, but there are real issues to solve first: 1. Infrastructure Gaps, most rural areas don’t have stable internet or electricity. data collection systems are still mostly manual. 2. Skills Shortage, there’s a lack of data scientists and AI specialists in government, also public sector workers need training to use tech confidently. 3. Data Privacy and Ethics, who owns the data collected and how do we protect citizens’ information from abuse? 4. Corruption and Resistance to Change-some officials may not want systems that reduce opportunities for bribery and AI threatens some traditional power structures.</p>
                  <p>For AI to work well in public service, Zimbabwe must: Invest in infrastructure: Reliable internet, data centres, and digital tools. Train workers: From junior clerks to ministers, everyone must learn how AI can help not fear it. Develop local AI policies: Create a clear national AI strategy that includes governance, ethics, and partnerships. Work with private sector and academia: Universities, tech hubs, and startups can co-create solutions with government.</p>
                  <p>Smart governance through AI is not a silver bullet but it’s a powerful tool. If done right, it can help build a Zimbabwe that’s more efficient, transparent, and fair. Imagine applying for your passport online, getting it delivered in a few days, receiving SMS updates, and tracking every step with no need to bribe anyone. That’s not science fiction it’s possible. But it needs vision, planning, and political will. The road to smart governance is long. But if Zimbabwe starts now step by step we’ll look back and realize that AI didn’t replace people it empowered them.</p>

                  <div class="article-meta">By Godfrey Nyoni | April 17, 2025 | Does Zimbabwe Need AI Regulations? </div>
              </div>
              
              <div class="article-content">
                  <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is growing fast across the world and Zimbabwe is starting to catch up too. From chatbots in banking apps to Dr CADx, which is developing AI-powered diagnostic tools to assist in early disease detection. AI is slowly becoming part of everyday life. It’s helping businesses work faster, farmers plan better, and even doctors make more accurate diagnoses. But as much as AI brings rewards, it also brings risks. The big question is: Does Zimbabwe need regulations to control AI, or should innovation be left to grow freely? Let’s look at both sides the risks, the rewards, and why regulation might matter for a country like Zimbabwe.</p>
                  <p>Before we talk about rules, let’s understand what AI is doing right. Zimbabwean businesses are using AI to analyse data, track customer behaviour, and improve services. For example: Cassava Smartech and EcoCash are implementing AI for fraud detection and mobile money transactions. Farmhut helps farmers make smarter planting and selling decisions using AI-driven weather and market analysis. AI is being used in diagnostics to help detect diseases faster, especially where access to doctors is limited. With support from NGOs and startups, AI-powered mobile health apps are helping rural clinics manage patient care. Also, some Zimbabwean students are using AI-powered platforms like Khan Academy and ChatGPT to help with learning, especially in places where there are few teachers or textbooks. Furthermore, Harare and Bulawayo are starting to explore smart city concepts. In the future, AI could help manage traffic, water systems, and even detect crime patterns.</p>
                  <p>Clearly, AI has the power to improve lives. But like any powerful tool, it can also cause problems. AI can automate repetitive jobs, which means some workers may be replaced by machines or software. For example: Call centre jobs are being replaced by chatbots. Retail and banking staff may be reduced as companies use AI systems to handle tasks. Without a clear plan to reskill workers, unemployment could rise in some sectors. AI also relies on collecting and analysing data sometimes very personal data. But who controls that information? Who protects it? If a chatbot collects your banking info, how is it stored? If cameras use facial recognition, is that data shared with anyone? Without laws to protect digital privacy, Zimbabweans could be exposed to identity theft or surveillance without their consent.</p>
                  <p>AI systems are trained using data, but if the data is biased, the AI becomes biased too. In countries like Zimbabwe, this could lead to: Discrimination in job hiring, if AI tools are not trained with local diversity in mind. Unfair loan approvals, where AI favours urban applicants over rural ones due to limited rural data. ln addition, if an AI tool makes a mistake who is responsible? The programmer? The business? The government? Without regulation, there’s no clear line of accountability when things go wrong.</p>
                  <p>Many countries around the world are already working on AI rules and ethics. The European Union has the AI Act, and countries like Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa are creating AI frameworks. Here’s why Zimbabwe should do the same:</p>
                  <p>1. Protect Citizens’ Rights: AI should not violate privacy, spread misinformation, or discriminate. Regulations would set standards for data privacy, define ethical use of facial recognition, chatbots, and personal data. Also, help people know when they’re interacting with an AI, not a human.</p>
                  <p>2. Promote Safe Innovation: Regulations don’t have to stop innovation they can guide it safely. With the right policies, Zimbabwe can encourage responsible tech startups, ensure AI projects are built with local values and cultural awareness and attract investors who prefer working in legally secure environments.</p>
                  <p>3. Build Public Trust: When people feel protected, they’re more likely to adopt new tech. If Zimbabweans trust AI, they’ll be more willing to use it in Banking, Healthcare, Education and in Agriculture.</p>
                  <p>4. Avoid Foreign Exploitation: Many global companies use African countries to test AI tools because regulations are weaker. Zimbabwe could become a target if it has no legal protections in place. Rules would protect: Citizens from being used as test subjects. Also, Local businesses from unfair competition with big tech giants.</p>
                  <p>If Zimbabwe chooses to regulate AI, here are some ideas: A National AI Policy: Set clear rules on how AI can and cannot be used in public and private sectors. Data Protection Laws: Update existing cybersecurity and data protection acts to cover AI-specific risks. Ethical Guidelines: Make sure all AI tools follow local values and avoid bias or harm. An AI Oversight Body: A government or independent group that reviews and approves high-risk AI systems. AI Skills Development: Require companies introducing AI to also invest in training </p>
                  <p>AI isn’t good or bad, it’s a tool. It all depends on how we use it. Zimbabwe has a chance to lead the way in responsible AI adoption, especially in Southern Africa. But without strong rules, the same technology that can lift people out of poverty might deepen inequalities. So yes, Zimbabwe does need AI regulations. Not to block progress, but to protect its people, guide its growth, and make sure everyone shares in the benefits. The future is digital, and the earlier we prepare for it, the better.</p>

              <div class="article-content">
                  <p>Zimbabwe’s healthcare system has faced many struggles over the years, shortages of doctors and nurses, lack of medicine, poor hospital infrastructure, and long travel times for patients in rural areas. But with the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), there is a new hope that technology could help close some of these gaps. The big question is: Can AI really help fix Zimbabwe’s medical problems, or is it just another dream that sounds good on paper?</p>
                  <p>Let’s look at how AI is being used in healthcare around the world, what it could do here at home, and what challenges we need to overcome. AI in healthcare means using machines and software to analyse data, make decisions, or help doctors treat patients more effectively. This can include: 1. Chatbots that answer health questions. 2. Apps that remind patients to take medicine. 3. Systems that can read X-rays or lab results. 4. Tools that help track disease outbreaks. The goal isn’t to replace doctors but to help them do their jobs faster and better especially where there are too few of them.</p>
                  <p>Before we talk about AI solutions, let’s be honest about the situation in the country: Doctor shortage: The World Health Organization says there should be 23 health workers per 10,000 people. In Zimbabwe, the number is less than 10. Long distances to clinics: In rural areas, people often walk 5 to 10 kilometres just to reach a clinic and sometimes there’s no doctor when they get there. Overloaded hospitals: Central hospitals like Parirenyatwa, Mpilo, and Sally Mugabe are overcrowded, with patients sleeping on floors and nurses under stress. Lack of lab equipment and specialists: Many hospitals can’t afford modern machines, and some medical tests take weeks to come back if at all. These are the real problems AI could help solve but only if used properly.</p>
                  <p>AI can analyse medical scans like X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans in seconds. In Zimbabwe, where specialists like radiologists are few, AI tools could help doctors quickly detect: Tuberculosis, Breast cancer, Lung infections, Heart conditions. Some tools even work on mobile phones. For example, a startup in Kenya uses AI-powered mobile X-ray machines to scan lungs and detect TB in rural villages. Zimbabwe could use similar tools to screen patients in remote areas and catch diseases early.</p>
                  <p>AI chatbots and mobile health apps can give basic medical advice, answer patient questions, or even help triage symptoms. Imagine a pregnant mother in Binga sending a WhatsApp message to a chatbot and getting advice about danger signs, nutrition, or baby movement. One example already working is Ada Health, a free health app being used in several African countries. It asks patients a few questions and gives suggestions on what to do next. Local Zimbabwean apps like Sasai Health are starting to test similar features.</p>
                  <p>Many patients in Zimbabwe struggle to keep follow-up appointments because of transport costs. AI-powered apps can help monitor patients remotely. For example: Remind diabetic patients to take insulin, Help HIV-positive patients track ARV doses, Alert nurses if a patient’s health data looks worrying. These tools are useful especially in rural areas, where health workers are stretched thin.</p>
                  <p>AI can also track patterns of diseases and predict where outbreaks might happen. For example, if more people in a district are complaining of diarrhoea through a chatbot or app, the Ministry of Health could be alerted early. This kind of system was used in Rwanda during the COVID-19 pandemic to monitor community symptoms and prevent virus spread. Zimbabwe could apply a similar model for cholera, malaria, or typhoid outbreaks.</p>
                  <p>Many Zimbabweans speak Shona, Ndebele, Tonga, and other local languages, but medical apps are often only in English. AI can help translate health information quickly and clearly. Some AI systems can even speak to patients in their mother tongue, making health education more accessible to all.</p>
                  <p>Some AI-related health initiatives are already happening in Zimbabwe: AI Garage Zimbabwe, a local startup hub, has held hackathons where young developers build AI-powered health tools. Econet Health partnered with doctors to create SMS-based health services that offer tips and reminders. The University of Zimbabwe’s College of Health Sciences has explored AI in research, especially in radiology and disease modelling. These are small steps, but they show local interest and potential.</p>
                  <p>AI could do a lot but there are also major hurdles:  Most public hospitals don’t have the internet speeds or reliable electricity needed to run advanced AI systems. AI also requires computers, servers, and maintenance costs that many rural clinics simply can’t afford. AI systems need people who understand both medicine and technology. Zimbabwe doesn’t yet have enough experts trained in AI healthcare, which could delay adoption or cause errors. People may be afraid of sharing medical information with apps or bots. Without strong laws, patient data could be misused or leaked. Zimbabwe’s Cyber and Data Protection Act (2021) is a start, but more is needed. AI needs to understand local customs and languages. A chatbot trained in Europe won’t know what a Zimbabwean means when they say “my stomach is running” or “I have heat in my chest.”</p>
                  <p>AI won’t fix every problem in Zimbabwe’s healthcare overnight. It can’t build new hospitals, replace dedicated nurses, or fix power shortages. But it can help stretch the limited resources we have further. With the right support training, infrastructure, and fair rules AI could save lives, reduce hospital pressure, and bring healthcare closer to every village and town. The question isn’t “Can we afford to use AI in healthcare?” It’s “Can we afford not to?”</p>

                  <div class="article-meta">By Godfrey Nyoni | April 3, 2025 | How Zim Businesses Can Use AI to Stay Competitive in Tough Economic Times</div>
              </div>
              
              <div class="article-content">
                  <p>Zimbabwe’s economy has seen its fair share of challenges rising costs, currency instability, and competition from global markets. In times like these, businesses must think smarter, work faster, and find new ways to survive. One of the most powerful tools that companies worldwide are using is Artificial Intelligence (AI). But here’s the big question: Can Zimbabwean businesses really benefit from AI? Or is it just for big international companies?</p>
                  <p>The truth is, AI isn’t just for tech giants like Google or Amazon. Zimbabwean companies whether small or large can use AI to cut costs, improve efficiency, and attract more customers. In fact, some local businesses are already seeing results from AI-powered tools. Let’s break it down.</p>
                  <p>Running a business in Zimbabwe means dealing with uncertainties fluctuating exchange rates, unpredictable supply chains, and changing customer demands. AI can help companies analyse trends and predict future changes so they can plan better. Retailers can use AI to analyse customer buying habits and stock up on the right products at the right time. Imagine a supermarket knowing exactly how many loaves of bread to order before a price increase, no waste, no losses. Farmers can use AI-powered weather forecasting to predict droughts and adjust planting schedules helping them avoid crop failure. One Zimbabwean startup, Farmhut, is already using AI to give farmers market insights and predict produce demand, helping them sell their crops at the right time for the best price.</p>
                  <p>With high business costs in Zimbabwe, every dollar saved counts. AI helps companies automate repetitive tasks, so they can get more done with fewer resources. Banks like CBZ and Steward Bank are already using AI-powered chatbots to handle customer service, reducing the need for large call centre teams. Manufacturers can use AI-powered machines to reduce errors in production, saving time and materials. For example, Delta Corporation uses automation to improve bottling efficiency. Even small businesses can benefit from AI-powered accounting software like Xero and Zoho Books can automate invoices, track expenses, and generate financial reports in seconds, saving business owners hours of manual work.</p>
                  <p>In a tough economy, every customer matters. Businesses need to attract more customers without spending a fortune on marketing. AI can help businesses find the right customers and personalize marketing efforts to increase sales. E-commerce stores like Techzim’s Market Square and brands selling on Kenshopping or Mukuru Groceries can use AI to recommend products based on what customers like. AI-powered chatbots can answer customer questions instantly, even outside business hours, keeping potential buyers engaged. Social media AI tools like ChatGPT, Hootsuite, and Buffer help businesses create content, schedule posts, and analyse trends making marketing more effective. Imagine owning a small clothing shop in Bulawayo or Harare and using AI to predict which styles will be popular next season. You stock up on the right items and sell out before your competitors even realize what’s trending.</p>
                  <p>Cybercrime is a growing problem in Zimbabwe, especially for businesses that operate online. Hackers target companies that lack strong cybersecurity systems, and a data breach can ruin customer trust and lead to huge losses. AI-powered cybersecurity tools can detect threats before they cause damage. Banks and fintech companies are already using AI to detect fraudulent transactions and protect customers’ money. E-commerce businesses can use AI to prevent fake transactions and scams. With Zimbabwe moving towards a more digital economy, businesses must invest in AI-driven cybersecurity to protect their data and their customers.</p>
                  <p>One major concern about AI is that it could replace human workers. While AI can automate certain tasks, it also creates new opportunities. AI is increasing demand for data analysts, AI specialists, and cybersecurity experts. Companies that adopt AI will need employees who can manage and maintain AI-powered systems. Businesses should invest in upskilling their employees so they can work alongside AI instead of being replaced by it. Startups like AI Garage Zimbabwe are already training young Zimbabweans in AI skills, ensuring that local talent can compete in the global job market.</p>
                  <p>AI has great potential, but adopting it isn’t always easy. Some of the biggest challenges include: Limited AI Knowledge – Many Zimbabwean businesses don’t know where to start with AI. High Costs – AI tools can be expensive, making it hard for small businesses to afford them. Internet and Power Issues – AI-powered services need reliable internet and electricity, which can be a challenge in some areas. Despite these challenges, Zimbabwean businesses shouldn’t ignore AI. Many affordable AI solutions exist, and businesses that start adopting AI early will have an advantage over those that wait.</p>
                  <p>AI isn’t a luxury it’s a necessity for businesses that want to stay competitive in Zimbabwe’s tough economic environment. It’s already helping businesses cut costs, improve efficiency, attract more customers, and stay secure. The question is no longer “Should Zimbabwean businesses use AI?” The real question is: “How fast can they adopt it before they fall behind?” The businesses that embrace AI now will lead the future of Zimbabwe’s economy.</p>

                  <div class="article-meta">By Godfrey Nyoni | March 27, 2025 | AI and the Zimbabwean Workforce: Job Creator or Job Destroyer?</div>
              </div>
              
              <div class="article-content">
                  <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is changing the way businesses work all over the world, and Zimbabwe is no exception. From banks using AI to stop fraud to farms using smart technology to predict weather patterns, AI is becoming a big part of our everyday lives.</p>
                  <p>But the big question is: Is AI helping Zimbabweans get more jobs, or is it making people lose work? Some fear that AI will replace human workers, while others believe it will create even more opportunities. The truth is it’s a bit of both. AI is already making waves in different industries, and whether it’s a job creator or job killer depends on how we use it.</p>
                  <p>Some jobs that require doing the same thing over and over again are being automated. On customer service: If you’ve ever chatted on WhatsApp with Econet or Steward Bank, chances are you interacted with an AI-powered chatbot before reaching a real person. These bots handle simple queries, reducing the need for human agents. In manufacturing: Delta Corporation has AI-powered machines that automate bottling and packaging, cutting down the need for human workers.</p>
                  <p>This sounds scary, right? But here’s the other side of the story AI is not just taking jobs; it’s also creating new ones. For every job AI takes over, a new kind of job is needed. Machines and software don’t just run themselves they need people to design, maintain, and manage them. For example, AI Developers & Engineers – People who build and improve AI systems. Data Analysts – Experts who analyse the data AI produces to help businesses make better decisions. Cybersecurity Experts – AI is great, but it also comes with security risks. Businesses need people to keep their systems safe. Machine Learning Trainers – AI isn’t smart on its own. It needs people to teach it how to understand and process data correctly. Startups like ZimCode, Impact Hub Harare, and AI Garage Zimbabwe are already training young Zimbabweans in AI-related skills so they can compete in the modern job market.</p>
                  <p>Zimbabwe’s economy runs on agriculture. With over 60% of the population working in farming, any technology that affects agriculture is a big deal. AI is making farming easier, more efficient, and more profitable. Farmhut, a Zimbabwean agri-tech startup, is using AI to give farmers market insights, weather predictions, and advice on pest control. Instead of replacing farmers, AI is helping them make better decisions, reduce waste, and improve profits. Some commercial farms are even using AI-powered drones to monitor crops, control irrigation, and detect diseases early. This means fewer crop failures and better harvests. But here’s the catch many small-scale farmers don’t have access to this technology yet. More investment in AI training for farmers could help rural communities benefit from these advancements.</p>
                  <p>AI is powerful, but Zimbabwe has a few challenges when it comes to fully embracing it: 1. Many Zimbabweans Don’t Have Digital Skills – AI-related jobs require coding, data analysis, and cybersecurity skills, which aren’t widely taught in schools. 2. Internet and Power Issues – AI runs on data, fast internet, and reliable electricity, all of which can be unreliable in Zimbabwe. 3. AI is Expensive – Many businesses can’t afford to upgrade to AI-powered systems, leaving them behind in the digital revolution. 4. Lack of AI Policies – Zimbabwe doesn’t yet have strong regulations on how AI should be used, which raises concerns about privacy, ethics, and fair job distribution.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheless, AI doesn’t have to be a threat; it can be a game-changer for businesses and workers if managed correctly. Here’s what needs to happen: 1. More AI Education – Schools and universities should introduce AI-focused courses so Zimbabweans can take advantage of new tech jobs. 2. Government & Private Sector Support – Policies should support AI innovation but also protect jobs and help workers transition to new careers. 3. AI for Small Businesses – Large companies are using AI, but SMEs should also get affordable AI solutions to help them grow. 4. Improving Digital Infrastructure – Better internet access and power supply will allow more businesses to integrate AI into their operations.</p>
                  <p>AI isn’t coming to take away jobs it’s coming to change them. Some traditional jobs will disappear, but new and better jobs will take their place. The key is adaptation. If workers upgrade their skills, businesses balance automation with job creation, and the government supports AI education, Zimbabwe won’t fall behind. Instead, AI can help the country’s workforce grow stronger, more efficient, and more competitive in the global market. So, the real question isn’t whether AI is a job creator or job destroyer it’s whether Zimbabweans are ready to embrace the change and make it work for them.</p>
